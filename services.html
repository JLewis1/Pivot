										<p>With Pivot Developments’ Data Management you can integrate all of your company data throughout your entire company. A unified, high quality data warehouse enables quick analysis of all data available, thus enabling prompt actions and reactions to market changes and trends. Highest-possible data quality standards are the centre of Pivot Developments’ philosophy and service offerings. Pivot Developments’ data management not only allows your company to integrate data from multiple disparate or non-disparate data sources. Pivot Developments ensures that your data is of the highest quality and is conforming to the highest demands throughout your company. With this data quality as a foundation, you can confidently make the business decisions that you need.</p>

										<p>Businesses today need to be able to react to customer wishes in a faster and more efficient manner. The need for integration of data from all systems and for a unified 360° view of customer profiles is becoming a requirement for all businesses. But in many companies, the IT organization is an ageing structure of heterogeneous IT systems which make this 360° view extremely difficult – or even impossible. Customer data needed for effective user profiling is distributed across multiple systems, with redundant data which dilutes the customer view. This disparate distribution of data makes it impossible for a unified user record to be created. Pivot Developments integrates disparate data sources across your company in order to create a unified customer view which will allow your company to be able to react quickly and efficiently to your customers’ needs.</p>

										<p>Pivot Developments’ professional services help you to transition your company’s data smoothly and free of redundant entries into a unified data repository hosted either within your IT infrastructure or hosted with a Tier 1 Provider. The consolidation of data requires that all data is complete, free of errors and no redundant items exist. If data quality in the differing source systems is sub-standard, this will have a negative effect on data quality in the unified data repository, and as such on the results of the Business Intelligence (BI) analysis.</p>

										<p>Pivot Developments consolidates data sets from all systems involved – company-wide. Using error-tolerant matching algorithms it can identify similar and identical datasets. Using this data as a basis, your company can create the perfect golden records and thus a 360° customer view.</p>

										<p>With Pivot Developments your company is able to keep its operative activities running efficiently. You can prepare analytic evaluations and organize further planning, and thanks to optimized data quality you can use new applications faster and more effectively. You keep within your budget limits and punctually comply with the schedule of your data project.</p>
